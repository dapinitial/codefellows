# Learning Objectives
* The students will be able to implement a linked list
* The students will be able to implement a doubly linked list
* The students will be able to identify use cases for linked lists

# Overview
#### Singly Linked List
* There are no FILO/FIFO-style constraints on Lists.
* Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a data field as well as a 'next' field, which points to the next node in line of nodes.
* Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include:
  * Insertion (Beginning, End, AfterNode(x), BeforeNode(x))
  * Deletion (Beginning, End, SpecificNode(x))
  * Traversal (Done from the head of the list)
* Singly Linked Lists can store both the Head and Tail pointers, though not a common implementation.

#### Doubly Linked List
* There are no FILO/FIFO-style constraints on Lists.
* Doubly linked lists contain nodes which have a data field as well as a 'next' AND 'prev' field, which points to the next and previous nodes in line of nodes.
* Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include:
  * Insertion (Beginning, End, AfterNode(x), BeforeNode(x))
  * Deletion (Beginning, End, SpecificNode(x))
  * Traversal (Done from the head or the tail of the list)
* Doubly Linked Lists commonly store both the Head and Tail pointers.

#### Exercise
* Implement removeFromHead and RemoveFromLastNode methods of Singly Linked List
* Implement removeFromHead and RemoveFromLastNode methods of Doubly Linked List

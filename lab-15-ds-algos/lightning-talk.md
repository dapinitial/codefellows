Watch [JSUnConf 2016 LTs]

## Learning Objectives
* Our community encourages involvement on many levels with the developer community as a whole, and lightning talks are a perfect way to get involved and share knowledge of a subject!
* Public speaking is often unnatural for people, and short focus presentations are an awesome entry point for shedding that fear.
* There are many instances in which developers are asked to provide input, either in client or team meetings. Having these public speaking skills are an important part of working within the industry.
* Start small with focus talks, and then move up to a larger talk! We may all be coming to watch your Key Note Presentation at PyCon, NodeConf, or an iOS DevCon someday!!

## Overview
* You will be given *FIVE* minutes to present on a topic of your choosing.
* The topic must be relatable in some way to software development, and is completely up to you.
* You will have five minutes after the previous talk to get your computer set up and ready for the presentation.
* Your presentation is timed, and when the time expires your presentation must end whether you're finished or not. 


#### Things you can talk about in five minutes
* Why my favorite module is X.
* I want to do cool project X. Does anyone want to help?
* Successful Project: I did project X. It was a success. Here's how you could benefit.
* Failed Project: I did project X. It was a failure, and here's why.
* Python Heresy: People always say X, but they're wrong. Here's why.
* Call to Action: Let's all do more of X / less of X.
* Wouldn't it be cool if X?
* Someone needs to do X.
* iOS Wish List
* Why X was a mistake.
* Why X looks like a mistake, but isn't.
* What it's like to do X.

* Comparison of modules X and Y.
* We should be paying more attention to X.
* My Favorite iTerm/zshell Feature

###### Tips and Tricks!
* Five minutes is not a long time! Get straight to the point.
* Edit, Practice, Edit, Practice, Edit, Practice, Edit, Practice.
* Time yourself, and know your presentation.
* Don't worry about introductions or background information.
* If you choose to use slides, don't use too many (3-5).
  * Put them on automatic timers to move you through the discussion without thinking about changing slides
  * This will help you stay on point, and force you to move forward if you ramble.
  * Don't put much on your slides... 3 bullet points or visuals should do the trick.
* Watch some lighting talks from NodeConf or another developer conference to see how it's done!

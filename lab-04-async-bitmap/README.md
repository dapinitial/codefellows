# Topics
* callbacks
* event emitters
* async-testing
* inheritance

## callbacks
* callbacks are functions as arguments
* one way to pass data around when working with asynchronous functions

## callbacks
* node event emitters are another way to handle passing asynchronous data

## async-testing
* use the `done` callback in mochas `it` block to force mocha to wait until a test has complete

## inheritance
* using `call` a Constructor function can inherit the properties from another Constructor
* using `Object.create` a Constructor can inheritance the prototype of another Constructor
 * this will inherit the other Constructor's methods!

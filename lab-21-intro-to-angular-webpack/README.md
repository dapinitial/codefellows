## Description
  * Create a cowsay application with same criteria as today's lecture demo:
  * Create an **app/index.html** file that contains your HTML markup
    * *hint:* be sure to include the `ng-app` directive to point to your default angular module
  * Create an **app/index.js** to house your application logic
    * require in your **app/scss/main.scss**
  * Setup an angular module and create a controller for your application logic
  * In your `index.html` file, include an `input` and `pre` tag that will be used to dynamically update the text of your cow
  * The `pre` tag should be a preview, showing the result of what was typed into the `input` field *(two way data-binding)*

## Bonus
  * **1pt** add a button that uses the `ng-click` directive to populate a second `pre` tag with the current `pre` tag's state
  * **1pt** add an additional button that uses the `ng-click` directive to reset the second `pre` tag with the content it last showed
  * **1pt** Add custom styles *(no wireframe based requirements - just be creative!)*

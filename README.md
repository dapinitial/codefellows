# codefellows

This is where I am housing everything that I learned in Codefellows with super instructors Charlie Crawford and Scott Schmidt.

Follow me on my journey through the full modern JavaScript tool chain as I learn ES6 and fulfill my requirements for my Advanced JavaScript certification.

Some of the tools that I use are:

MEAN STACK (ES5/ES6):
---
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- Angular.js (v1) w/ Angular UI Router
- Node.js

- Homebrew
- Yarn, Grunt, Gulp, NPM
- WebPack 2 and WebPack Dev Server
- Babel
- bcrypt
- Karma + Jasmine for testing, sometimes Mocha/Chai
- SCSS, Stylus, LESS

Some of the things that I dabble in Full-Stack Web Development are: web APIs, CRUD, promises, test-driven development, behavior-driven development, routes, route testing, unit testing, Authentication, Authorization, factory functions, writing services, dependency injection, closures, data structures, algorithms, linked lists, stacks and queues, binary search tris, and many more! I use a f*** ton of JavaScript plugins. Just check my growing package.jsons!

- I am using Github, the Terminal, Robomongo, Postman, and probably some other tools.
- My editor is setup with Fira Code for funky operators and fat arrow functions!
- DuoTone Dark by the designer of Atom is my theme... Will be tweaking shortly.
